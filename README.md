## 🕹️ About the Game

This is a browser-based **strategy game** developed using **vanilla JavaScript**, arrays, and custom game logic. It includes multiple game loops and decision branches to challenge players with logic-based gameplay mechanics.

> ⚠️ Note: The project is **partially complete** as per client instructions and currently runs **manually** (no backend automation or save/load system).
